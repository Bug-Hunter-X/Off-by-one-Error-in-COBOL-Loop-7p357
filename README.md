This repository demonstrates a common, subtle error in COBOL programs: an off-by-one error in a loop. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The program's goal is to count from 1 to 10, but the loop condition might contain a potential mistake.  Review the code to identify and understand the error, and learn how to prevent such issues in your own COBOL programs.
